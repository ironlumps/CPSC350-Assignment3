Assignment #3

The files that are included are the main.cpp, SyntaxChecker.h and .cpp files and the template class GenStack.h

There wasn't really any problems that I ran into when making this code, other than a few weird bugs with the delimiters not working properly but that was solved pretty easily and some minor stuff with the template class. 

The sources I used were a few websites listed below and Joaquin Valencia and Ademir Vila
